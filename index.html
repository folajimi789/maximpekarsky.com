                            My passion in life is to create impactive, memorable experiences with code and music. In the past, I've built apps to <a href = "http://theygotfit.com" target = "_blank"> log and track fitness progress </a> and <a href = "http://heartheirside.com" target = "_blank">break out of the 2016 election echo chamber</a>. I co-founded a  <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/BUExplorchestra" target = "_blank">a 35-person composers' orchestra</a>, ran <a href = "http://lookingforbagpipes.wordpress.com" target = "_blank">a Humans of New York-inspired crowdfunding campaign</a>, collaborated on a <a href = "http://bossfightgame.com" target = "_blank">web turn-based multiplayer game</a>, and <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/maxim-pekarskiy/albums" target="_blank" > freelanced as a film composer</a>.

                        <p>
                            I think about people first and tools second. Before I every touch my tools, I draw on data and observation to develop empathy for my users.
