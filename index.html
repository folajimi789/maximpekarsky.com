                            My passion in life is to create impactive, memorable experiences with code (Node/Express.js, Rails, Vue.js) and music. I am currently building and growing <a href = "https://www.hackterms.com" target = "_blank"> Hackterms</a>, a crowdsourced dictionary of programming terms. In the past, I've built apps to help users find<a href = "http://theygotfit.com" target = "_blank"> fitness inspiration </a>, break out of the 2016 election <a href = "http://heartheirside.com" target = "_blank">echo chamber</a>. I co-founded <a href = "https://www.facebook.com/BUExplorchestra" target = "_blank">a 35-person composers' orchestra</a>, ran a Humans of New York-inspired <a href = "http://lookingforbagpipes.wordpress.com" target = "_blank">crowdfunding campaign</a>, and <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/maxim-pekarskiy/albums" target="_blank" > freelanced as a film composer</a>.    
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I think about people first and tools second. Before I ever start building, I draw on data and research to develop empathy for my users.

                                    Minimal at the surface, Hackterms is built with user accounts and moderator/admin roles, secure password management and reset, oAuth login, responsive styling, a submission approval queue, term category graphics, and much more.

                                <p>It's hard for composers to find a whole orchestra of musicians to play their music. In 2009, while a sophomore at Binghamton University I co-founded an orchestra dedicated to exclusively playing music written by its members. Although the concept of a composers' orchestra is not new, Explorchestra thrives because it welcomes musicians and composers from every genre of music and level of training. Explo creates an environment where an indie rock guitarist can collaborate with a classically trained orchestrator to compose, conduct, and premiere a neo-Romantic composition.

                                <p>In June of 2014, the popular Humans of New York blog published a photo of a homeless bagpiper who had his instrument stolen. After an incredible response in the comment section, I set up a crowd funding campaign that raised $1800 in 1.5 hours. I then found the map in the photo, tracked down his bagpiper maker of choice a renowned bagpipe maker - first in Scoltand, then in Bulgaria - and ordered a custom set with the money we raised. The bagpipes were delivered to Malcolm, the man in the photograph and a musician of 40 years, in August
                                of 2014.
