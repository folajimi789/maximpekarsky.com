                            My passion in life is to create impactive, memorable experiences with code and music. In the past, I've built apps to <a href = "http://theygotfit.com" target = "_blank"> log and track fitness progress </a> and <a href = "http://heartheirside.com" target = "_blank">break out of the 2016 election echo chamber</a>.

                            I think about people first and tools second. Before I every touch my tools, I draw on data and observation to develop empathy for my users.

                        I grew up playing viola and studied music composition with a focus on film scoring. You can see my complete work on my <a href = "https://soundcloud.com/maxim-pekarskiy/albums" target="_blank" >Soundcloud</a>. Here are a few projects I've worked on for music and theater productions:

                            <span class = "bold">Run</span> is a snippet of a score I did for a short film of the same name. After unwittingly witnessing a crime in which he's now the primary suspect, the unnamed main character takes off for a desperate run through the city. As he runs, he witnesses scenes that encapsulate his own run. I wrote a Danny Elfman-inspired orchestral score, facing the challenge of frequently evolving the themes with each passing (short) scene.

                            <span class = "bold">Flatlander Montage</span> is a montage theme for <a href = "https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/891136975/hole" target = "_blank">Hole</a>, a short film by Brian McCann. The film explores the idea of parallel dimensions, and this electronic track underscores a research montage where the main character is researching the surreal and mysterious phenomena he's recently been experiencing.

                            <span class = "bold">Fortinbras Unleashed</span> is the electronic main villian theme for a post-apocalyptic Shakesperean zombie Drama, <a href = "http://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/13/theater/reviews/living-dead-in-denmark-at-gene-frankel-theater.html?mcubz=0" target = "_blank">Living Dead in Denmark</a>, written by Qui Nguyen and staged by the Just Kidding Theater Company. The play explores the delicate balance between good and evil, as the (spoiler alert!) zombie-fighting protagonists slowly come to realize they are zombies themselves.
